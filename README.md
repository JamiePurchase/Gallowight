Gallowight
==========

Tablet RPG made with Android Studio
-----------------------------------

### Overview

Gallowight is a 2D tile-based RPG set in a fantasy world. I'm creating this game to learn about Java development for Android.

### Objectives

I hope to have a basic world to explore, with a player walking around the board as directed. There should be a simple menu and message display soon. Battle system to come later.

### Features

Original World
* I have quickly drawn all of the boards myself

Touch Controls
* User input is entirely based on touch and gestures
* Player movement is achieved by dragging in a direction on the screen
